**Magma oceans on young planets play a critical role in shaping their atmospheres and mantles. Recent observations
of ultra-short-period (USP) exoplanets, such as K2-141b, provided materials to further investigate the physical
properties of these oceans. While existing machine learning models can predict their viscosity, no model currently
addresses glass density in a wide range of melt compositions.
This study introduces a novel artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict glass density from melt compositions.
We apply this model to estimate the surface density of an hypothetical glassy magma ocean on K2-141b.**


This project was carried out under the supervision of Charles Le Losq.
